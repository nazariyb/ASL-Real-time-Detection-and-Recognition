# ASL Real-Time detection and classification

## Get it working
1. Firstly, just run this command to create virtual enviroment with all requirements:
```
conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt
```
and activate it:
```
conda activate <env>
```
2. Download weights for models from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GQLPHOC0Dbp3iny4N_-8Q5mWPorvwN5K?usp=sharing) into the folder `weights` (you should create it).

3. Then run (on linux use `python3` instead of `python`)
```
python main.py
```
Alternatively, you can start `jupyter notebook` and open file `main.ipynb` (and run cells, of course).
<br>To exit the program just press `q` when its window is active.
